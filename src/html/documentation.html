                        <p>Once you see the form to create an A/B test (Fig 1.3), you should title your test and determing how large the A/B Test sample size should be. There is a calculator on the page to help you determing how large of a sample size you need to get a minimum detectable effect. It is recommended that you use that number, but you do not have to.</p>

                        <p>Every A/B Test needs to have groups to test against. You can create an A/B Test Group by clicking on the "Add Group" button on the A/B Test form (Fig 1.4). You can add as many groups as you like. Each A/B Test Group needs to have a distribution percentage, a name and a slug. The distribution percentage defines what percentage of impressions are assigned to each group. The name field is so that you an identify your group when you log into Data-Driven Design and the slug field is so you can programatically determine which control group a user is in. Think of the slug as a human-readable identifier.</p>

                        <h3>API Key</h3>
                        <p>Once an A/B Test has been created, it is immediately ready to be used through Data-Driven Design REST APIs. The first thing you will need is your API Key, which is located on the dashboard home screen (Fig 2.1).</p>
                        <p>The API Key is what Data-Driven Design uses to identify that it is your app making requests for your A/B Tests. Every api call needs to have the api_key parameter as a query string on your requests:</p>
                        <code>
                            http://datadrivendesign.com/abtests/impressions?api_key=APIKEY
                        </code>

                        <h3>Technical Terms</h3>
                        <p>Users in A/B Tests have 3 main terms: Participants, Impressions, and Conversions.</p>
                        <p>A <em>Participant</em> is a user who has interacted with any of your A/B Tests. We keep track of participants to ensure that they are only assigne to one A/B Test Group per A/B Test at any given time.</p>
                        <p>An <em>Impressions</em> is when a <em>Participant</em> is placed into an A/B Test Group. Once a <em>Participant</em> has been placed into an A/B Test Group, they will always in that A/B Test Group.</p>
                        <p>A <em>Conversion</em> is when a <em>Participant</em> does the action that you are trying to measure. For example, if you are testing Blue Buy button versus Red Buy button, and a user clicks on the Red Buy button, that is considered a conversion for the Red Button A/B Test Group. Once a <em>Participant</em> has converted, subsequent conversions will not be counted.</p>

                        <h3>Generic Workflow</h3>
                        <p>The following is a generic workflow for when a user visits a page where an A/B Test is running:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>User lands on page</li>
                            <li>App makes a request to Data-Driven Design to assign the <em>Participant</em> and A/B Test Group</li>
                            <li>Save a reference to the <em>Participant's</em> ID so you can keep track of future visits by participant.</li>
                            <li>Once A/B Test Group has been determined, your use the A/B Test Group slug to render UI based on that <em>Participant's</em> A/B Test Group.</li>
                            <li>When <em>Participant</em> converts, send request to Data-Driven Design with <em>participant</em> id to record conversion.</li>
                        </ul>
